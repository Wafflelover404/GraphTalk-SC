## Introduction
Machine learning is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data.
It's revolutionizing how we approach complex problems.

## Types of Machine Learning

### Supervised Learning
Uses labeled data to train models. Examples:
- Classification (spam detection)
- Regression (price prediction)

### Unsupervised Learning
Finds patterns in unlabeled data. Examples:
- Clustering (customer segmentation)
- Dimensionality reduction (data compression)

### Reinforcement Learning
Learns through trial and error with rewards. Examples:
- Game playing (AlphaGo)
- Robotics (autonomous navigation)

## Key Algorithms
1. Linear Regression
2. Decision Trees
3. Neural Networks
4. Support Vector Machines
5. K-Means Clustering

## Applications
- Healthcare: Disease diagnosis
- Finance: Fraud detection
- Retail: Recommendation systems
- Transportation: Autonomous vehicles

## Conclusion
Machine learning continues to advance rapidly, with new techniques
and applications emerging constantly."""

Based on the provided document [ml_guide.pdf], reinforcement learning 
is a type of machine learning that learns through trial and error with 
rewards.

Key characteristics:
- Uses reward-based learning approach
- Learns optimal actions through experience
- Does not require labeled training data

Examples from the document:
1. Game Playing: AlphaGo - the AI that mastered the game of Go
2. Robotics: Autonomous navigation systems

The document also mentions that reinforcement learning is one of three
main types of machine learning, alongside supervised and unsupervised 
learning [ml_guide.pdf - see Types of Machine Learning section].
